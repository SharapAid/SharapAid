### 👾 Who am I?

- 🧠 I'm **just starting out** in the magical (and occasionally terrifying) world of programming.  
- 🧰 I write **C++**. That's it. Pure, raw, metal C++.
- 🐧 Linux lover — mostly because Windows gave up on me.
- 💣 I broke my own PC with a recursive function once. It was beautiful.
- 🔥 Current mood: 
  > "Segmentation fault (core dumped)"

### 🤹‍♂️ Fun Facts About Me:

- I once wrote a "Hello World" that took 30 lines... and I regret nothing.
- My Git commits are 50% code, 50% panic fixes.
- I use dark theme not because it's cool, but because my code is *too bright*.

### 🔧 Currently tinkering with:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::cout << "SharapAid is learning C++... wish me luck!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
