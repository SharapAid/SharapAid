### 🎮 Who am I?

- 💻 Visual Studio user by day, C++ noob by night.
- 🧰 Writing **pure C++**, because I like living dangerously.
- 🐧 Linux rebel—because Windows has trust issues.
- 🌊 Once saw water catch fire in anime and thought:  
  **"What the hell, water burns?!"**

### 🔧 Currently tinkering:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::cout << "If water can burn, I can learn C++!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
